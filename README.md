# Password-Generator

(Yes the folder is mispelled, I guess I never recovered from my second grade spelling bee where I spelled science as sentence......)

This is my first project using Javascript.
The idea is to give the user full flexability on their password (within reason).
The first thing that I knew hwat I had to do was to make sure users stay within the limits of this page and try not to break it.
